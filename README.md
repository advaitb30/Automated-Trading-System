Task1 was reading up the basics o stock market and indicators used to make trades

Task2 includes the python code for a simple trading bot. We used the following python libraries: Numpy, pandas, matplotlib(for plotting the data and indicators), dates and an API library yfinance(Yahoo finance).

Task 3 was exploring ML, through simple regression models on pytorch.

Task 4. I created a basic Neural Network which outputs a buy(1) or sell(0) signal based on indicators. For training the model I used a dataset from Kaggle which contains 3k+ entries of the NIFTY 50 index of frequency '1d'. the accuracy of the model comes to about 58% which isn't great per normal standards, but given the simplicity of the mode, it is a great accuracy.
