Thoroughly navigate through the stepping stone file to understand how the implementation has been done, to back test. 
Tasks:
1. Template code has been provided in the trading signals, modify this code to generate maximum profits for the symbol 'JSWENERGY.NSE'. Since only last one month data can be acquired for 1m data, need to fix the date. For 1 May to 31 May, the profit should be maximised.
2. Try to reason out, what can be the potential flaws of this code. (it isn't flawed in any major way, but from your perspective, what do you think needs to be addressed).
Optional tasks:
3. Convert the stepping stone code to make it simulate for one year based on one day data (open or close).
